libraries used- OS Module, JSON Module 
used os module to go to some directory and open files as read / write mode
used json module to store data 
approach:
used oops to define class user and two of its daughter classes --> admin and student
defined some special function for both admins and students
after this i made sure that to create the two json files that i will be using in the code for storing data , if those file do not exist in the users computer
i also used ansi escape sequence for my colored terminal (i just copy pasted my previous work for this function)
after this the code is pretty self explanatory as i added some comments in between the code
